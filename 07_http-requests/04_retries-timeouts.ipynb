    "\n",
    "- By default, `requests` may wait indefinitely for a response, which is risky in automation.\n",
    "- Use the `timeout` parameter with a single value for both connect and read, or a tuple `(connect, read)` for fine-grained control.\n",
    "- A `ConnectTimeout` is raised if the connection can’t be established in time; a `ReadTimeout` is raised if data stops arriving within the read timeout."
